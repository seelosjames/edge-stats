Basic Project (Ready to Put on Resume)
Step 1: Scraping Data
Goal: Use Selenium (or other scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup if needed) to scrape odds from sportsbooks.
Actions:
Set up a Python project and install necessary libraries: selenium, pandas, psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL), etc.
Identify the sportsbooks you want to scrape data from (start with one or two for simplicity).
Write a scraper using Selenium to extract betting odds (e.g., for specific games or player props).
Store the scraped data in a structured format (CSV or directly in a PostgreSQL database).
Ensure your scraper handles edge cases like pagination, CAPTCHA, or site structure changes.
Skills: Web scraping, Python, PostgreSQL, data storage.
Deliverable: A script that collects odds and stores them in a database.
Step 2: Data Storage (Database)
Goal: Store the scraped betting data in a PostgreSQL database for easy querying and future analysis.
Actions:
Set up a PostgreSQL database and create tables (e.g., bets, sportsbooks, games, odds).
Import the scraped data into your database using SQL or pandas's to_sql() function.
Ensure you have basic SQL queries for pulling data (e.g., finding the best odds for a particular game).
Skills: SQL, database design, data storage.
Deliverable: A functioning database that stores scraped odds and basic querying abilities.
Intermediate Project (More Advanced, Ready for Resume)
Step 3: Value Bet Identification
Goal: Implement an algorithm to identify value bets based on odds and probabilities.
Actions:
Define what qualifies as a "value bet" (e.g., an opportunity where the implied probability of a bet is less than the actual probability of success).
Write a function that calculates the implied probability from odds (e.g., for decimal odds: 1 / odds).
Compare the implied probability with your calculated probability (this could be from a basic statistical model or a fixed probability based on team performance).
Store the value bets in the database for later use.
Skills: Probability, algorithm development.
Deliverable: A system that identifies value bets from the scraped odds data.
Step 4: Data Exploration and Analysis
Goal: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the betting data.
Actions:
Use Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn to analyze trends in the odds and identify factors that influence value bets.
Generate visualizations like time series charts, histograms of odds distributions, etc.
Perform basic statistical analysis on how often value bets actually succeed and which types of bets tend to provide value.
Skills: Data analysis, statistics, visualization.
Deliverable: An analysis report with visualizations and insights.
Step 5: Prediction Model (Basic)
Goal: Build a basic predictive model to forecast game outcomes based on historical data.
Actions:
Collect more data to train a simple machine learning model (e.g., past team/player performance, weather data, etc.).
Use a basic machine learning model like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to predict game outcomes (win/loss).
Use your modelâ€™s predictions to enhance value bet identification.
Evaluate model accuracy with standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
Skills: Machine learning, model evaluation.
Deliverable: A machine learning model that predicts game outcomes.
More Advanced Project (Impressive for Resume)
Step 6: Time Series Analysis or Advanced Modeling
Goal: Use more sophisticated methods (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, or ensemble models) for predicting betting odds or outcomes.
Actions:
Implement a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or LSTM) to predict changes in odds over time based on historical patterns.
Enhance your predictive model with more advanced techniques such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) for more accurate predictions.
Analyze how predictive performance improves with advanced models.
Skills: Time series analysis, deep learning, advanced machine learning techniques.
Deliverable: A more advanced model for predicting odds or outcomes with better accuracy.
Step 7: Anomaly Detection
Goal: Detect outliers or errors in the betting data (e.g., identifying odds that deviate significantly from the historical trend).
Actions:
Implement anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest or Autoencoders to identify bets or odds that are outliers.
Use these anomalies to potentially identify "edge cases" or exploitable opportunities.
Skills: Unsupervised learning, anomaly detection.
Deliverable: Anomaly detection for identifying irregular betting data or opportunities.
Step 8: Web Scraping Automation & Monitoring
Goal: Automate the entire scraping, storing, and value betting process, running it regularly for real-time insights.
Actions:
Set up scheduled scraping using cron jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
Integrate webhooks or a notification system (e.g., email, Slack) to alert you when value bets are detected.
Build an API or dashboard to display data and value bets.
Skills: Automation, scheduling, notifications, API development.
Deliverable: An automated system that scrapes data and identifies value bets regularly.
Step 9: Deployment (Optional for More Advanced)
Goal: Deploy your project to a server or cloud to make it accessible from anywhere.
Actions:
Host your project on a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.
Set up an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to show the betting insights, predictions, and value bets.
Deploy a REST API to serve predictions or insights to other users or applications.
Skills: Cloud deployment, web development.
Deliverable: A cloud-hosted, interactive version of your project.
